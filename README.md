# Project_3_Single_View_Modeling
In this project we compute 3D affine measurements from a single perspective view of a scene given only minimal geometric information determined from the image. This minimal information is typically the vanishing line of a reference plane, and a
vanishing point for a direction not parallel to plane. The algorithm is based on the paper [Single View Metrology](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp5421/Password_Only/projects/svm/SingleViewMetrologyFinalReport.pdf).<br>
